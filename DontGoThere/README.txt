README 
======================

This project was created by Anish Ghai from Parramatta High School in 2018.

Don't Go There is a story based platformer about a block and an external force telling it to not go certain places. But naturally 
because of curiousity...you will got there :) 

This game generates levels by having two images, a collision image and a detail image. 
The collision image is made up of pure #000000 pixels. The code scans for these pixels and adds a collision system there. The detail image, is place on top of the collision
image to make the map looks pretty, and provide a user friendly experience.

This project is already converted to processing.js for you. Just click the index.html file to start running it. It is tested on Safari (MacOS). 

Since sound libraries are not supported in processing.js, this uses a special file called minim.js open sourced code provided by Daniel Hodgin (https://github.com/Pomax/Pjs-2D-Game-Engine/blob/master/minim.js)
This enables sound to work by emulating minim. Thanks David!

Hope the judges have fun playing the game. It consists of 10 levels.

Enjoy!
